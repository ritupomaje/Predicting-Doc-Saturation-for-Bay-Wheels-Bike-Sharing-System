With the rapid expansion of the bike-sharing industry which is valued at $6.6 billion globally in 2022 and estimated to grow more than 10% annually companies like Bay Wheels are coming under increasing pressure to maximize operation and rider convenience. 
Maybe the most critical threat to the user experience is dock saturation, when docking stations are full to capacity and cyclists are unable to return their bike. 
This not only results in frustration and inconvenience to customers but also in operational bottlenecks which affect system reliability. 
To help Bay Wheels with this problem, I have performed a detailed analysis with the use of a dataset that consists of environmental and operating featues like temperature, humidity, wind speed, season, hour of day, and day of week, in addition to the target variable, SATURATED, indicating whether or not a station was full at a given moment.

I have performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) like descriptive statistics, histograms, and correlation heatmaps, etc. 
This has helped in understanding the patterns of user demand and environmental impact on saturation. 
In particular, warmer temperatures and commuting times were linked to higher saturation, whereas precipitation and humidity had the opposite effect. 
Following data cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values and prepare the data for modeling, I created four models: Logistic Regression, Classification Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Machines.
These models pointed out the strongest predictors of dock saturation and they also allowed for the development of a forecasting system that Bay Wheels can use to proactively manage station capacity.

The output of this analysis gives Bay Wheels key understanding on when and why saturation occursâ€”either due to commuter ridership in heavy volumes, recreational volume growth at various seasons, or temperature-induced volumes in increased ridership. 
The ultimate goal is to supply Bay Wheels with accurate projections for facilitating smarter bike allocation strategies, reducing customer drop-off due to the lack of enough availability, and maximizing general customer satisfaction with their growing base.
